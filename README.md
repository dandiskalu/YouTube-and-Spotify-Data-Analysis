# YouTube-and-Spotify-Data-Analysis
Demonstration of data analysis with Pandas

This project analyses data from musical artists and tracks from YouTube and Spotify and includes and compares streams, views, likes, etc, of the top artists on both platforms.

I used Pandas to organize and analyse the data together with Matplotlib.
